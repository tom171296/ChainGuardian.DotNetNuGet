# Securing NuGets supply chain
In an era dominated by digital dependencies, the software supply chain plays a pivotal role in shaping the technology landscape. As consumers, we often download and integrate various packages to enhance the functionality of our applications. NuGet is a package manager for the Microsoft development platform. However, as we embrace the convenience of integrating third-party packages, it becomes imperative to address the lurking shadows of potential vulnerabilities in the software supply chain.

## Software Supply Chain
Software applications are no longer built entirely from custom code. Instead, they are made up of a variety of third-party components, including open-source libraries, frameworks, and modules. These components are often referred to as dependencies. The software supply chain is the process of managing these dependencies and their security risks.
